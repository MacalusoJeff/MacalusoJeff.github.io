Welcome to my GitHub page! This is a place for showcasing my personal projects, thoughts, ideas, the code I use for competitions, and so on. I'll have more in my regular GitHub, so check that out if you want to see other projects that aren't fully complete. I believe in sharing information with others, so feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.

I'm a machine learning engineer and I was formerly a data scientist for nearly a decade. Here you'll find a mix of ML, statistics, data analysis, data visualization, and so on. Python is my primary language, but I've also done a few things in R and had sometimes played around in Julia.

I'm an Austin native turned PNW local, I spend a lot of time with my wife and dogs, and I like solving problems with data. I also enjoy climbing, trail running, hiking, listening to/playing/writing music, reading, traveling, and playing board games with friends.
